# Dynamic signal reproduction
A simple LabVIEW VI for the real-time reproduction of signals saved a .json file. 

## Run:
run 'dynamic_signal_generation.vi'.
Use the data (data.txt) as an input file. This code reproduces the data in data.txt as a real-time signal. Here the first column is for time and the second one for acceleration.

## Hardware :

NI-9263 4-Channel (Voltage output module), cDAQ-9178 8-Slot, USB CompactDAQ Chassis, oscilloscope
